# Banal Platitudes
>A web app that generates images superimposed with only the most typical and tiresome banal platitudes from the English language.

## Why? 

In the latter half of the common year of 2018 my best friends Joaqy, Alex, and I took a lot of L's.

### What do you mean by "take an L"?
>"to take an unfortuante loss and turn of events" - Source: [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=took%20an%20L)

We managed to get over our respective plights by the only ways we knew how: long chats on the phone, feral humor, trips to [Beverly's](http://beverlys.nyc/), and long nights out sometimes followed by a regretful Uber ride back home to Jersey.

### Everything happens for a reason

In providing comfort to each other (because that's what best friends are for ❤️), we would often find ourselves laughing at our accidental, but frequent assertions of some of the most banal platitudes we knew. We liked seeing who could out do each other. Joaqy and I would often tie.

>Everything always works out in the end

>What’s done is done

>Time heals all wounds

## Banal platitudes for all to share

This web app generates text superimposed over a generic, "inspirational" landscape image (think a beach at sunset or a mountain range with some clouds). The chosen text is a random selection of the most typical and tiresome banal platitudes that can be found on the web. You can generate as many images as you like - each with their own random banal platitude. You can share the image on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, or download it to your computer or phone.

Exhibit A: Image 

Feel free to share these with the world. It's all in your hands, but remember...

## Contributing

I came with the idea after thinking what I wanted to submit to [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) as part of my application to one of their 12-week retreats. I'm totally open for pull requests with bug fixes, changes in documentation, or new features to the app.
